# utopian.overview
https://anilkilic.github.io/utopian.overview/

Simple tool to get a feeling about what's approved & what's not on [Utopian.io](https://utopian.io)
Designed for graphics section in mind. Might be expandable for other categories.

## Roadmap
- Query steem instead of utopian, to get images.
- ~Display posts in page without going to website.~
- Add pagination for big query limit
- Upload to a database for less query?
- ~Beautify interface~
- Routes for users to display their works, e.g. /@oups.
